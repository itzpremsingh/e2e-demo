# üîê Python End-to-End (E2E) Encryption Demo

**Python E2E Encryption Demo** is a simple project to show how **end-to-end encryption** works using **public-private key pairs**. Messages sent from **User A** to **User B** remain private ‚Äî even the server cannot read them.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Generate **public and private keys** for each user.
- Encrypt messages with the **receiver‚Äôs public key**.
- Decrypt messages with the **receiver‚Äôs private key**.
- Demonstrates the **core concept of E2E encryption** in a simple way.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Key Generation**
   Each user creates their own public and private key pair.

2. **Message Encryption**
   Sender encrypts the message using the **receiver‚Äôs public key**.

3. **Message Decryption**
   Receiver decrypts the message using their **private key**.

4. **Privacy**
   Even if the message is intercepted, it cannot be read without the receiver‚Äôs private key.

## üì¶ Example Usage

1. Generate keys for User A and User B.
2. User A encrypts a message using User B‚Äôs public key.
3. User B decrypts the message using their private key.
4. User B can reply securely using User A‚Äôs public key.

## üèÉ How to Run

1. Start the **server**:

```bash
python main.py server
```

2. Start a **client**:

```bash
python main.py client
```

3. Follow the prompts to send encrypted messages between clients.

          |                                     |
          | Encrypt message using B's public key
          |----------------------------------->|

          |                                 Decrypt using B's private key
